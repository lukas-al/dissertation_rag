      " Context 0: Committee continues to judge that the risks to its modal inflation projection are skewed to the upside. Second-round effects in domestic prices and wages are expected to take longer to unwind than they did to emerge. There are also upside risks to inflation from energy prices given events in the Middle East. Taking account of this skew, the mean projection for CPI inflation is 2.2% and 1.9% at the two and three-year horizons respectively. Conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates at 5.25%, which is a higher profile than the market curve beyond the second half of 2024, mean CPI inflation returns to target in two years’ time and falls to 1.6% at the three-year horizon. The MPC’s remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. Monetary policy will ensure that CPI inflation returns to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term. Since the MPC’s previous decision, there has been little news in key indicators of \n",
      "Context 1: wholesale prices, the drag from utilities price inflation is then expected to fade from the second half of this year . Retail fuel prices fell earlier than utilities prices, and therefore the related drag has largely come through in the latest CPI data. The contribution of retail fuel prices to inflation is projected to be closer to zero in 2024 Q1 and positive in Q2, although that relies on the Government choosing to go ahead with theChart 2.18: Consumer price inflation has fallen since last year’s peak and is projected to fall further before rising again in 2024 H2 Contributions to CPI inflation (a) Sources: Bloomberg Finance L.P., Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, ONS and Bank calculations. (a) Figures in parentheses are CPI basket weights in 2023. Data to December 2023. Component-level Bank staf f projections from January 2024 to June 2024. Diamonds indicate projections for headline inflation in 2024 Q3 and Q4. The food component is defined as food and non-alcoholic beverages (FNAB).

      "Context 2: declined to 6.5% in the three months to November, around 1 percentage point below the expectation in the November Report. This has brought the AWE measure back into line with the steer from other indicators of annual pay growth, which lies between 6% and 7% (Chart 2.15). Recent outturns in wage growth have also continued to be stronger than standard models of wage growth, based on productivity, short-term inflation expectations and a measure of economic slack, would have predicted (Chart 1.4). The MPC continues to judge that private sector regular AWE growth will ease more slowly than the range of forecasts from this suite of models would predict, consistent with its broader judgement that second-round effects in both domestic prices and wages will take longer to unwind than they did to emerge. Overall, the near-term outlook for pay growth is weaker than projected in the November Report, with the annual growth rate of private sector regular AWE projected to decline to around 4¾% by 2024 Q2 and to end this year at a similar rate. However, this profile also reflects an MPC judgement to push up slightly on pay growth in the near term, in light of the stronger forward-looking indications \n",

In the Bank’s NMG survey, the measure of households’ expectations for\\ntheir own financial situation over the next year has improved substantially since 2022 and\\nis now in line with results prior to the pandemic. Survey responses also suggest that\\nhouseholds’ perceived risk of job loss has been falling and is now at its lowest level since\\n2015, although expectations for the level of economy-wide unemployment have increased\\nslightly over the past six months. The NMG’s measure of household income expectations\\nhas also risen, although this largely reflects the expectation that nominal incomes will\\ngrow given high inflation.\\nDuring the pandemic, household consumption fell by more than income as households\\nwere less able to spend on services, which meant that in aggregate households built up\\nadditional savings. Much of these additional savings took the form of bank deposits. As\\nshown on the left of Chart 3.4, the total stock of household deposits rose materially ,\\npeaking around 10% higher than its previous trend in 2022 Q1. A similar pattern has been\\nobserved across advanced economies (IMF (2023) ).…although households in the NMG survey remain',\n",

It offers no information regarding the change in the employment rate between 2019 Q4 and the three months to July 2022, nor does it make any reference to the LFS estimates or the context given in the instruction. Instead, it introduces an entirely unrelated topic with a metaphorical sentence about a fox and a dog. This response fails to meet any of the criteria outlined in the score rubric, as it is neither correct, accurate, nor factual in relation to the given context or question. Therefore, based on the lack of relevance to the task, it is evident that this response does not fulfill the expectations set by the instruction and the score rubric. So the overall score is 1.
